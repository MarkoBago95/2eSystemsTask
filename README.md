Here is my backend assignment

Hi,
here is my backend assignment for job aplication.

I gave myself the freedom to add a frontend part and some features to make it easier to test the app.
Also, as an automatic task (metar) i have implemented one external api call to the controller so we have real time information every time we request data for a specific airport.
To create a database(CREATE DATABASE AIRPORTS) in the repository there are sql files for both tables with some data.

The application runs in a linux terminal as command: $ mvn spring-boot:run   , and is used in one of the web browsers at localhost:8080
